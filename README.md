# Number Guessing Game

A simple, interactive Number Guessing Game built with React. The game allows users to guess a number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is higher or lower than the target number, and it will notify the user once they have guessed correctly.

## Features

- The user is prompted to guess a number between 1 and 100.
- The game provides feedback, letting the user know if their guess is too high or too low.
- When the user guesses correctly, a message is displayed, and a new number is generated after a short countdown.
- Responsive design to ensure the game works on various screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: For styling the components and ensuring responsiveness.
